### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alexandra Bridgeland, and I recently graduated magna cum laude from Virginia Tech with a  B.S. in Systems Biology.  
I am hoping to pursue a PhD in systems biology or a similar discipline.  Eventually, I want to work at a pharmaceutical company where I can create computational models of the effect of drugs on signaling pathways.  Throughout my time in college, I have developed computational and analytical skills through my systems biology coursework and research experiences.   Specifically, I have experience with various types of computational modeling and bioinformatics.  Additionally, I have experience in Python, R studio, MATLAB, and some more obscure programs
